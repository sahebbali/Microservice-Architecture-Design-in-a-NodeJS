# Microservice Architecture Design

To set up and run the application, follow these steps:

# Step 1: Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine. Then, navigate to your project directory and run the following command to install dependencies:
This command installs Express.js for building the web server and Mongoose for MongoDB object modeling.

```bash
npm install
```

# Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Set up your environment variables. Create a .env file in my project directory and define your MongoDB connection URI. For example:

```bash
MONGO_URI= your_db_name
```

# Step 3: Define Order Schema

Create a file named Order.model.js to define the MongoDB schema for orders. You can use the schema I am already defined.

# Step 4: Create Controllers

Create controller files for handling order-related logic. For example, Order.controller.js containing functions like CreateOrder, getAllOrders, getOrderById, updateOrder, partialUpdateOrder, deleteOrder

# Step 5: Set Up Routes

Create a file named routes.js to define routes for my application. Include routes for creating orders and retrieving all orders.

# Step 6: Implement Express App

Create an Express app in a file, let's say index.js, where you configure your routes, connect to MongoDB, and set up middleware.

# Step 7: Run the Application

Start your application by running the following command:

```bash
Npm start
```
